gcc6.3* Files
-------------
These files are used to form the baseline list of warnings to enable. Warnings
to be added manually are in gcc6.3-manual-warnings... and the contents have to
be added to the command line in the script file. Once this is up to date the
file gcc6.3-disabled-warnings-after-wall-wextra-manual.txt contains a list of
warnings which remain disabled after Wall, Wextra and the manual additions.
